          <p>
            I am Sonya "Sunny" Lawrence-Thompson, a curious and intrinsically
            motivated Analyst with a passion for solving complex problems and
            crafting strategic solutions. My journey through the consumer 
            goods, manufacturing, and healthcare industries has sharpened my 
            analytical skills and deepened my love for data-driven decision-making.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I thrive on challenges that require a blend of systematic thinking
            and creativity. My expertise in Python, SQL, Database Manipulation,
            and financial analysis tools like Excel and Power BI enables me to
            turn data into actionable insights. I'm always learning and pushing
            the boundaries of what is possible, whether it be automating a 
            process or diving into a new project with fresh eyes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I believe in finding the right solution for every problem, and I am
            driven by a disciplined approach and a relentless curiosity. My 
            goal is to leverage my skills to make a meaningful impact, all while
            staying true to my love for learning and exploration.
          </p>
